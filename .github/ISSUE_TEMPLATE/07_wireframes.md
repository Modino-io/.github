# Definition of done
### Solution Quality
- [ ] Provided design answers to all Acceptance Criteria described in the related issue

   - [ ] Primary flow ("happy path")
   - [ ] Secondary flows (e.g. unexpected input, something fails,…)
   - [ ] Behaviour specs included for every wireframe (screen-to-screen interactions, general behaviour, inputs, …)
- [ ] Provided design follows the style and requirements set by [Material](https://material.io/)
- [ ] Provided design follows the style and requirements set by [Modino](figma link)
- [ ] 0 errors found by Figma checkers (if cannot be achieved, explain why or create a follow up issue)
- [ ] Wireframe interactions are included in the prototype

### Common Agreement
- [ ] Development team confirmed that there are no technical limitations or restrictions
- [ ] Design critiques were held; At least one meeting and one asynchronous feedback on Figma.
- [ ] Design team agrees on provided solution
- [ ] PM / architect were participating in design critiques. Sprint playback must not be a surprise for them.
