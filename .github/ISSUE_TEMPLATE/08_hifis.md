# Definition of done
### Solution Quality
- [ ] [If there's room for exploration] Create 2 â€“ 3 variations of (exemplary) visual designs
- [ ] Provided design follows the style and requirements set by [Material](https://material.io/)
- [ ] Provided design follows the style and requirements set by [Modino](https://www.figma.com/files/project/63530307/Libraries?fuid=1123560620713370098)
- [ ] Interactions are included in the prototype
- [ ] Colors and typography are set by library variables
- [ ] Hand-off (once screens are final)
  - [ ] If necessary, graphical assets made exportable through Figma

### Common Agreement
- [ ] Development team confirmed that there are no technical limitations or restrictions
- [ ] Design critiques were held; At least one meeting and one asynchronous feedback on Figma.
- [ ] Design team agrees on provided solution
- [ ] PM / architect were participating in design critiques. Sprint playback must not be a surprise for them.

### Documentation
- [ ] Once a Figma file is created, mark the Wireframes story as "having a HiFi file"
- [ ] Document design decisions and agreements
- [ ] Recordings of design critiques added in comments of the story
- [ ] FEDs crossreference their issue to this one
- [ ] Once finished, the story has been moved to the [Catalogue](https://www.figma.com/files/project/50585973/Modino.io-Catalogue?fuid=1123560620713370098)
- [ ] Once the story has been moved to the Catalogue, mark the story as moved to Catalogue
