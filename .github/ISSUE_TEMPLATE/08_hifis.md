# Definition of done
### Solution Quality
- [ ] Progress documented in this issue each day you worked on this story
- [ ] Figma link to working file documented in this issue
- [ ] [If there's room for exploration] Create 2 â€“ 3 variations of (exemplary) visual designs
- [ ] Design Critiques held until the design team is happy
- [ ] Hand-off (once screens are final)
  - [ ] If necessary, provide redlines in a separate frame with suffix "SPECS" (frame-name--SPECS)
  - [ ] Graphical assets made exportable through Figma
  - [ ] Figma link shared (for FEDs and other non-paid seats)
  - [ ] Respective FED(s) have been personally notified
  - [ ] Ideally ask for their implementation user story to cross-link to this one

### Common Agreement
- [ ] Development team confirmed that there are no technical limitations or restrictions
- [ ] Design critiques were held; At least one meeting and one asynchronous feedback on Figma.
- [ ] Design team agrees on provided solution
- [ ] PM / architect were participating in design critiques. Sprint playback must not be a surprise for them.

### Documentation
- [ ] Progress was documented each day you worked on this story; document design decisions and agreements
- [ ] If needed, information flows were visualized in Figma
- [ ] Figma prototype was connected with the corresponding front-end issue
- [ ] Issue was moved to correct place on board, "who: design" label has been removed
